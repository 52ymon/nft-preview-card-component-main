## My process

-   I think I had a small breakdown while doing this challenge. Ofc the w3schools.com was a massive help with this one. I had to rewrite my css 3 times and then it finally worked as I wanted. Had 2 breakes, one for a coffee and thinking about what am I doing with my life, and one for a little cry under a shower. Thankfully it's done now and I'm sure I learned a lot from it.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
